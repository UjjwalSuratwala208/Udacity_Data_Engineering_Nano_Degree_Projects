Description
--------------------
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. 
The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. 
Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, 
as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app. 
This app would help load the data in star schema, for better understanding what songs users are listening to.


Schema Design
-----------------------
- Fact table
songplays - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent

- Dimentions table
users - users in the app user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level

songs - songs in music database song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration

artists - artists in music database artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude

time - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday

List of scripts
---------------------------
sql_queries.py - includes (CRUD) queries create_tables.py - Resets the database by droppoing and recreating the tables etl.py - loads the json files for songs and logs dataset from the data folder on the db in star schema structure


Steps to Run
----------------------------
In the project directory, execute:
python create_tables.py
python etl.py
